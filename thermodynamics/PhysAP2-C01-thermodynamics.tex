\section{Temperature}

\textbf{Temperature} is:
\begin{itemize}
\item a measure of the ``coldness''/''hotness'' of an object
\item more accurately, a measure of the average
  \textbf{internal energy} of an object. (We will be defining that energy
  in our discussion)
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Thermometric Properties}

A \textbf{thermometric property} of an object is a physical property that
change with temperature. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Electrical resistance of a copper wire
\item The length of an iron rod
\item The volume taken up by mercury
\item Pressure exerted by a gas
\end{itemize}
An object is in a \textbf{thermal equilibrium} when
\begin{itemize}
\item thermometric properties are no longer changing
\item heat is transferred in and out of the object at the same rate
%  %\item has the same temperature as its surroundings
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics}
\textbf{Zeroth law of thermodynamics:} If two thermodynamic systems are each in
thermal equilibrium with a third, then they are in thermal equilibrium with
each other.
\begin{itemize}
\item Two objects $A$ and $B$ are in thermal equilibrium if the
  temperatures of the objects are the same
\item Equal amounts of heat (energy) are flowing from $A$ to $B$ and from
  $B$ to $A$
\item Establishes temperature as a measurement of heat, and allows us to
  define temperature scales
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Celsius Temperature}

For water, there are two equilibrium conditions that occur at atmospheric
pressure consistently:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Ice point} (or \textbf{normal freezing/melting point}) where
  water and ice exist at this temperature in thermal equilibrium, and
\item\textbf{Vapour point} (or \textbf{normal boiling point}) where water and
  water vapour exist in thermal equilibrium
\end{itemize}
In the \textbf{Celsius scale}, \SI0{\celsius} is the ice point, and
\SI{100}{\celsius} is the vapour point\footnote{Fun fact: When Celsius first
proposed the scale, the ice point was defined as \SI{100}{\celsius} while the
vapour point was defined as \SI0\celsius. This means that the number gets
bigger as it gets colder. But within a very short time, the scale was changed
to the current form}



\subsection{Absolute Temperature}

William Thomson (better known by his title: Lord Kelvin) and James Prescott
Joule discovered that when a gas is heated or cooled at \emph{constant volume},
there is always a \emph{linear} relationship between pressure and temperature,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:abs-temp}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}[rotate=25,thick,OrangeRed]
      \draw[dashed] (0,0)--(1,0);
      \draw (1,0)--(5,0);
    \end{scope}
    \begin{scope}[rotate=32,thick,MidnightBlue]
      \draw[dashed] (0,0)--(1,0);
      \draw (1,0)--(5.2,0);
    \end{scope}
    \draw[axes] (0,0)--(5,0) node[right]{$T_C$};
    \draw[axes] (2,0)--(2,2.5) node[left]{$P$};
    \draw (0,0)--(0,-.15) node[below]{\SI{-273.15}\celsius};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The relationship between pressure and temperature is linear at
    constant volume}
  \label{fig:abs-temp}
\end{figure}
This relationship is true regardless of the type of gas, amount of gas, or the
volume of gas. More crucially, pressure is always zero at \SI{-273.15}\celsius.
Since pressure cannot be negative; no temperature can exist below that value.

The \textbf{absolute temperature} $T$ (also known as the
\textbf{thermodynamic temperature}) is obtained by shifting the ``null point''
(where temperature is zero) from the Celsius temperature $T_C$.
\begin{important-equation}
  T = T_C + 273.15
\end{important-equation}
A temperature of \SI0{\kelvin} is called \textbf{absolute zero} (Note that
absolute zero is impossible to obtain because of quantum-mechanic effects,
discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:quantum}). This scale is consistent with
physical and thermodynamic properties of gases. Note that the temperature
\emph{change} of \SI1{\kelvin} is the same as \SI1\celsius, i.e.:
\begin{important-equation}
  \Delta T=\Delta T_C
\end{important-equation}


\section{Thermal Expansion}

When temperature $T$ of an object with length $L$ increases, the object
\emph{usually} expands. The \emph{thermal strain} ($\Delta L/L$) is
proportional to the change in temperature ($\Delta T=T_f-T_i$) by the
\textbf{coefficient of linear thermal expansion} ($\alpha$):
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \frac{\Delta L}L\approx\alpha\Delta T
  }
\end{equation}
%  \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
%      \rowcolor{pink}
%      \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
%      Length & $L$ & \si\metre \\
%      Change in length & $\Delta L$ & \si\metre \\
%      Change in Temperature & $\Delta T$ & \si{\kelvin} or \si{\celsius}\\
%      Coefficient of linear expansion & $\alpha$ & \si{\per\kelvin} or
%      \si{\per\celsius}
%    \end{tabular}
%  \end{center}
$\alpha$ is independent of pressure for solids and liquids, but may vary
with $T$.
%
%
%
%
%{Thermal Expansion}
There is also a similar expression for \textbf{coefficient of volume expansion}:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\frac{\Delta V}V\approx\beta\Delta T}
\end{equation}
$\beta$ is also independent of pressure for solids and liquids, but may vary
with $T$.
%  \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
%      \rowcolor{pink}
%      \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
%      Volume      & $V$  & \si{\metre\cubed} \\
%      Change in volume & $\Delta V$ & \si{\metre\cubed} \\
%      Change in Temperature & $\Delta T$ & \si{\kelvin} or \si{\celsius}\\
%      Coefficient of volume expansion & $\beta$ & \si{\per\kelvin}  or
%      \si{\per\celsius}
%    \end{tabular}
%  \end{center}

Careful application of calculus shows that for isotropic material (where
$\alpha$ is the same in all direction):
\begin{equation}
  \beta = 3\alpha
\end{equation}



\section{Ideal Gas Law}

\subsection{Kinetic Theory of Gases}
We begin the study of the thermodynamics of ideal gases using these assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The gas consists of a large number of identical molecules that are in
  high-speed random motion
\item Molecular motion and interaction obey Newtonian laws of motion (i.e.\
  $\bm F_\text{net}=m\bm a$)
\item Collision between molecules and with the walls of the container are
  \emph{elastic} (i.e.\ both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved)
\item Molecules are separated, on average, by distances that are large
  compared to their diameters (i.e.\ the space occupied by the molecules are
  small compared to the space occupied by the gas as a whole)
\item The only forces that the molecules experience are \emph{contact} forces
  (i.e.\ no gravitational, electrostatic forces on each other except when
  they collide)
\end{enumerate}
%
%
%
%
\subsection{Random Motion}
What does ``random motion'' mean in this case?
\begin{itemize}
\item Velocity vectors of all the gas molecules are different: some molecules
  move faster, some more slowly
\item There is no preferred direction to the motion
\item The average velocity of the gas molecules\footnote{This kind of average
is called an ``ensemble average'', which will be discussed later} is zero
\item The average \emph{speed} of the gas molecules is not zero (depends on
  temperature)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Volume of a Gas}
\textbf{Volume} is the amount of space occupied by the gas, with an SI unit of
\textbf{cubic metre} (\si{\metre\cubed}).
%  \begin{center}
%    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.3]
%      \draw[very thick] (-.1,-.1) rectangle (2.1,2.1);
%      \foreach \i in {1,...,90} \fill[red] (rand+1,rand+1) circle (.04);
%    \end{tikzpicture}
%  \end{center}
%  The volume of a gas is \emph{not} the sum of the volumes of the individual
%  atoms or molecules. Most of this occupied volume is empty space.
%
%
%
%
\subsection{Density of a Gas}
The \textbf{density} is the ratio of the mass of the gas and the volume
occupied by the gas:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \rho=\frac MV
  }
  \end{equation}
The SI unit of density is \textbf{kilogram per cubic metre}
(\si{\kilo\gram\per\metre\cubed}).
%  \begin{center}
%    \begin{tikzpicture}
%      \draw[very thick] (-.1,-.1) rectangle (2.1,2.1);
%      \foreach \i in {1,...,90} \fill[red] (rand+1,rand+1) circle (.04);
%    \end{tikzpicture}
%  \end{center}
For an ideal gas, the density is very low. (The reality is that no gas is truly
ideal. However, the lower the density, the better the gas is approximated as an
ideal gas. This is why helium is a very close to an ideal gas.)
%  %The volume of a gas is \emph{not} the sum of the volumes of the individual
%  %atoms. Most of this occupied volume is empty space.


\subsection{Pressure}

When gas molecules collide, they exert a force on each other and on the
container. The \textbf{pressure} is that force $F$ that a gas exerts on the
container, divided by the surface area of the container $A$ when the molecules
collide with it:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    P=\frac FA
  }
\end{equation}
The SI unit of pressure is \textbf{pascal} (\si\pascal) which is the pressure
exerted when \SI1{\newton} of force is spread over an area of
\SI1{\metre\squared}:
\begin{equation*}
  \SI1\pascal=\SI1{\newton\per\metre\squared}
\end{equation*}
At thermal equilibrium, pressure is evenly distributed in the gas

%%{Relationship Between Temperature and Pressure}
%%  More accurately, the relationship between absolute temperature $T$ and
%%  pressure $P$ of a gas at constant volume is defined using its triple point:
%%
%%  \begin{equation}
%%    T=\frac{T_\text{tp}}{P_\text{tp}}P
%%  }
%%
%%  \textbf{Triple point} is a combination of pressure and temperature where the
%%  solid, liquid and vapour phases of a substance may coexist in thermal
%%  equilibrium.
%%  \begin{itemize}
%%  \item The triple point temperature for water is at
%%    $T_\text{tp}=\SI{273.16}\kelvin$, or $\SI{.01}\celsius$
%%  \item Triple point pressure for water is $P_\text{tp}=\SI{611.2}\pascal$
%%  \end{itemize}

\section{Ideal Gas Law for Low-Density Gases}
Robert Boyle (1627-1691) discovered that, when a gas is allowed to expand or
compress at \emph{constant temperature}, the product of pressure $P$ and $V$
remain constant (\textbf{Boyle's law}):
\begin{equation}
  PV=\text{constant}
\end{equation}
From the previous discussion on the absolute temperature scale, we also know
that at \emph{constant volume}, temperature is proportional to pressure.
Combining the two discoveries yields this equation:
\begin{equation}
  PV=CT
\end{equation}
where ``C'' is some constant to be determined.

Thought experiment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two identical containers with the same volume $V$, same amount of same
  kind of gas, at same pressure $P$ and same temperature $T$
\item When the containers are combined and the molecules are free to move,
  $P$ and $T$ remain the same, but $V$ and $N$ both increases by factor of 2
\end{itemize}
Therefore $C$ must scale with the number of molecules $N$, which
modifies the equation to the \textbf{ideal gas law}:
\begin{important-equation}
  PV=Nk_BT
\end{important-equation}
The constant $k_B=\SI{1.381e-23}{\joule\per\kelvin}$ is called
\textbf{Boltzmann's constant}. It is found experimentally to have the same
value for any kind or amount of gas. The ideal gas law is often expressed in a
different form in chemistry courses:  
\begin{important-equation}
  PV=nRT
\end{important-equation}
where: $n=N/N_A$ is the number of moles of the gas;
$R=k_BN_A=\SI{8.314}{\kilo\gram\per\mol.\kelvin}$ is the
\textbf{universal gas constant}, and
$N_A=\num{6.022e23}$ is \textbf{Avogadro's number}, which is the number of
molecules in one mole\footnote{One \emph{mole} of substance is the number of
atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 atoms. This number is also related to the
definition of the \emph{unified atomic mass unit}, which will be discussed in
the last topic of the course, on nuclear physics.} of the substance. Both
version of the idea gas law is commonly used.
%The ideal gas law relates all the quantities that define the \emph{state} of a
%gas: pressure $P$, volume $V$ and temperature $T$. Both forms of the equations
%are used in this book



\section{Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution}

As gas molecules collide elastically with each other inside the container,
%\footnote{Recall the discussion on elastic collision from AP
%  Physics 1, or Physics 12, except for gases, collisions are not in one
%dimension (which are very easy) but in three dimensions.}:
some molecules \emph{gain} kinetic energy (therefore moving faster), while
other molecules \emph{lose} kinetic energy (therefore moving slower).
Individual collisions are random occurrences, i.e. when collisions occur is
determined by probabilities), but the overall behaviour of the molecules at
thermal equilibrium is very predictable.

At thermal equilibrium, the distribution of particle speeds $v$ for an ideal
gas in a container at temperature $T$ is given by the
\textbf{Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution} function:
\begin{equation}
  f(v,T)=4\pi\left[\frac m{2\pi k_BT}\right]^{\frac32}v^2
  \exp\left[-\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}\right]
\end{equation}
At this point, we are not very concerned with the (very difficult) mathematics
of how this equation is derived. Rather, we are most interested in the
consequence of this equation. The distributions of speeds at \SI{300}\kelvin,
\SI{300}\kelvin, and \SI{1000}{\kelvin} for helium (which is a monatomic gas)
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:maxwell-dist}.

The Maxwell-Boltzmann function is a type of function called a
\textbf{probability distribution function}, or
\textbf{probability density function}. It describes the probability/likelihood
of finding a molecule between speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$. The area under any
probability distribution curve is 1, which means that all probabilities sums to
\SI{100}\percent). For the Maxwell-Boltzmann function, this would be the area
from $v=0\rightarrow\infty$. We can also note that the peak (mode) of this
distribution shifts to higher speeds as $T$ increases.
%\item The peak, which represents the most-probable speed $v_\text{prob}$,
%  is lower at higher temperatures

There are three particles speeds that are important: the most-probable speed
$v_\text{prob}$, the mean (average) speed $\langle v \rangle$ and the
root-mean-square speed $v_\text{rms}$, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dist-speeds}.

  \caption{Most probable, average, and RMS speeds}
  \label{fig:dist-speeds}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Most Probable Speed}

The \textbf{most probable speed} $v_\text{prob}$ is the peak (i.e.\ mode) of the
distribution function. This is the speed you are most likely to find a molecule
travelling at:
\begin{important-equation}
  \text{Most probable speed:}\quad
  v_\text{prob}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_BT}m}=\sqrt{\frac{2RT}M}
\end{important-equation}
where $m$ is the molecular mass of the gas, $R$ is the universal gas constant,
and $M$ is the molar mass (i.e.\ the mass of 1 mole of the substance).
$v_\text{prob}$ is obtained through using basic calculus\footnote{Albeit not
necessarily simple. It involves finding the derivative of $f(v)$ and solving
for $v$ where $f'(v)=0$.}. We can see that the most probable speed is
proportional to the square root of absolute temperature:
\begin{equation*}  
  v_\text{prob}\propto\sqrt T
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Mean/Average Speed}

The \textbf{mean speed} $\langle v\rangle$ (or \textbf{average speed}) is the
arithmetic average of $N$ particles:
\begin{equation}
  \langle v\rangle =\frac{v_1+v_2+\cdots+v_N}N
\end{equation}
\begin{important-equation}
  \text{Mean speed:}\quad
  \langle v\rangle =\sqrt{\frac{8k_BT}{\pi m}}=\sqrt{\frac{8RT}{\pi M}}
\end{important-equation}
The above value for $\langle v\rangle$ is obtained using basic integral
calculus\footnote{The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function is continuous
in $v$, so this is done by computing the integral
$\langle v\rangle=\int_0^\infty vf(v)\dl v$. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
acts as a weighting function}. Like $v_\text{prob}$, $\langle v\rangle$ is
also proportional to square root of absolute temperature:
\begin{equation*}
  \langle v\rangle\propto\sqrt T
\end{equation*}
%
%
%
\begin{remark}
  In any physics course that you have previously taken, you would have
  encountered at least two types of averaging:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Time averaging} (when the physical quantity of a \emph{single}
    object evolves over time). For example, average velocity, average
    acceleration (kinematics) and average force (momentum and impulse) are:
    \begin{equation*}
      \bm v_\text{avg}=\frac{\Delta\bm x}{\Delta t}\quad\quad
      \bm a_\text{avg}=\frac{\Delta\bm v}{\Delta t}\quad\quad
      \bm F_\text{avg}=\frac{\Delta\bm p}{\Delta t}
    \end{equation*}
    
  \item\textbf{Spatial averaging} (when the physical quantity of a
    \emph{single} object evolves over some distance). For example, the work
    done by the average force:
    \begin{equation*}
      F_\text{avg}=\frac W{\Delta x}
    \end{equation*}
  \end{itemize}
  Notice that there are \emph{two} definitions of average force. It is
  important to understand what kind of averaging we are doing

  In this current example, the averaging is the arithmetic average amongst
  \emph{many} particles. This is known as an \textbf{ensemble average}. If
  there are $N$ particles, each with a physical property $X$, the ensemble
  average of $X$ (the notation is $\langle X\rangle$) is defined as:
  \begin{equation}
    \langle X\rangle = \frac{X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_N}N=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i}N
  \end{equation}
  For a large number of gas molecules, travelling with random motion, we care
  about the average speed ($\langle v\rangle$) and the average of the speed
  squared ($\langle v^2\rangle$)
\end{remark}




\subsection{Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Speed}

When studying ideal gases, we are \emph{most} interested in the average
\emph{kinetic energy} $\langle K\rangle$ of the gas molecules, which scales
with $v^2$. The average value of $v^2$ (i.e.\ $\langle v^2\rangle$) is therefore
\begin{align}
  \nonumber \langle K\rangle &=\dfrac{K_1+K_2+\cdots+K_N}N\\
  \nonumber &=\dfrac{\frac12mv_1^2+\frac12mv_2^2+\cdots+\frac12mv_N^2}N\\
  \nonumber &=\frac12m
  \underbracket[1.3pt]{
    \left[\frac{v_1^2+v_2^2+\cdots+v_N^2}N\right]
  }_{\langle v^2\rangle}\\
  \langle K\rangle &=\frac12m\langle v^2\rangle
\end{align}
Using ``basic'' integral calculus, we can show that
\begin{equation}
  \langle v^2\rangle=\frac{3k_BT}m
  \label{eq:rms-speed}
\end{equation}
\begin{remark}
  For anyone with a calculus background, the expression for the RMS speed
  (Eq.~\ref{eq:rms-speed}) is derived by the integral
  \begin{equation*}
    \langle v^2\rangle=\int_0^\infty v^2f(v)dv
  \end{equation*}
  The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function acts as a weighting function
\end{remark}
The speed that gives the average kinetic energy is called the
\textbf{root-mean-square speed} $v_\text{rms}$, which is the square root of
$\langle v^2\rangle$:
\begin{important-equation}
  \text{RMS speed:}\quad
  %\underbracket[1pt]{v_\text{rms}=\sqrt{\langle v^2\rangle}}_{
  v_\text{rms}=\sqrt{\expval{v^2}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_BT}m}=\sqrt{\frac{3RT}M}
\end{important-equation}
``Root mean square'' literally means ``the square root of the mean of the
square''. Like $v_\text{prob}$ and $\langle v\rangle$, $v_\text{rms}$ is
also proportional to the square root of absolute temperature:
\begin{equation*}
  v_\text{rms}\propto\sqrt T
\end{equation*}



\subsection{Average and Total Energy of an Ideal Gas}

From the expression of $v_\text{rms}$, and relating to the average kinetic
energy, it is easy to show the average kinetic energy of $N$ ideal-gas
molecules is:
\begin{equation}
  \langle K \rangle=\frac12mv_\text{rms}^2=
  \frac12m\left[\sqrt{\frac{3k_BT}m}\right]^2
  \quad\rightarrow\quad
  \boxed{\langle K\rangle=\frac32k_BT}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the \emph{total} kinetic energy of an ideal gas scales linearly with
temperature:
\begin{equation}
  K_\text{total}=N\langle K\rangle\quad\longrightarrow\quad
  \boxed{
    K=\frac32Nk_BT=\frac32nRT
  }
\end{equation}




\section{First Law of Thermodynamics}

The first law of thermodynamics is application of law of conservation of
energy (Chapter~\ref{chapter:energy})
which is arguably the most important concept in fundamental physics
\begin{definition}
  \textbf{Law of Conservation of Energy:} The change in the total energy of a
  system $E_\text{sys}$ is equal to the net external mechanical work
  $W_\text{ext}$ done from outside the system.
  \begin{equation}
    \boxed{
      \Delta E_\text{sys}=W_\text{ext}
    }
    \label{eq:conservation-of-energy}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
The \emph{consequence} of the law of conservation of energy is that,
\begin{definition}
  \textbf{Law of Conservation of Energy:} In an isolated system, energy cannot
  be created or destroyed; it can only change in form.
\end{definition}
In general, the total system energy is the sum of all the kinetic and potential
energies of the objects in the system in the macroscopic scale, collectively
called the \textbf{mechanical energy} of the system:
\begin{equation}
  E_\text{sys} = \sum K + \sum U
  \label{eq:sys-energy}
\end{equation}
Depending on the system, there may be multiple objects with kinetic energy
(therefore we have the \emph{sum} of kinetic energies), and potential energies
can be gravitational or elastic.

From Eq.~\ref{eq:sys-energy}, the \emph{change} in total energy is the total
change in all the forms of energy:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E_\text{sys} = \sum\Delta K + \sum\Delta U
\end{equation}
But have we accounted for \emph{all} the energies in the system?

Let us consider a container of gas with a total mass $m_\text{tot}$, oscillating
from the ceiling, at a height $h$ about the surface of Earth, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:big-system}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \input{thermodynamics/all-energies}
  \caption{An isolated system with a vertically oscillating container of gas}
  \label{fig:big-system}
\end{figure}
We can defined an isolated system that includes the mass, the spring, and
Earth. At the macroscopic level, the system has a total mechanical energy which
includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{bulk} kinetic energy of the entire container in motion:
  \begin{equation*}
    K=\dfrac12 m_\text{tot}v^2
  \end{equation*}
\item A gravitational potential energy stored between the mass and Earth:
  \begin{equation*}
    U_g=m_\text{tot}gh
  \end{equation*}

\item An elastic potential energy stored in the stretched/compressed spring:
  \begin{equation*}
    U_e=\frac12kx^2
  \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
But the random motion of the air molecules also contribute to additional energy
of the system, called the \textbf{internal energy}, or \textbf{thermal energy},
$E_\text{int}$ which is the sum of all their kinetic and potential energies at
the \emph{microscopic} level:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    E_\text{int}=K_\text{micro} + U_\text{micro}
  }
\end{equation}
We should not be surprised that internal energy is a function of the molecules'
absolute temperature. We must now also consider the internal energy of the
system in the equation for energy conservation:
\begin{align}
  E_\text{sys} &= \sum K + \sum U + \sum E_\text{int}\\
  \Delta E_\text{sys} &= \sum\Delta K + \sum\Delta U + \sum\Delta E_\text{int}
\end{align}
When applying the law of conservation of energy to a \emph{thermodynamic}
system, we note there is no change in bulk kinetic energy and potential
energies, since no matter how fast the container moves, or how high it is above
Earth, or how much the spring stretches, the temperature of the gas inside would
not be affect. The only energy change to the system is its \emph{internal}
energy. This reduces the equation to:
\begin{equation}
  \xcancel{\sum\Delta K} + \xcancel{\sum\Delta U} + \Delta E_\text{int}=
  W_\text{ext}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, aside from the (macroscopic) mechanical work done, there is also a
``non-mechanical'' transfer of energy (i.e.\ work done at the
\emph{microscopic} level), called \textbf{heat transfer} $Q$. The law of
conservation of energy becomes the first law of thermodynamics:
\begin{definition}
  In the \textbf{first law of thermodynamics}, the change in internal energy of
  a thermodynamic system ($\Delta U$) is the sum of the heat transferred ($Q$)
  and the net external mechanical work ($W$) done \emph{to} the system
  \begin{equation}
    \boxed{
      \Delta U=Q+W
      \label{eq:1st-law-of-thermodynamics}
    }
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
Note that by convention, Eq.~\ref{eq:1st-law-of-thermodynamics} is written in a
\emph{slightly} different notation from the last slide by convention, in that
here, we use ``$U$'' for internal energy instead of macroscopic potential
energy.

\begin{remark}
  \textbf{IMPORTANT NOTE:} The equation is also often written as
  $\Delta U=Q-W$, where $W$ is the work done \emph{by} the system. Since both
  conventions are commonly use, you must be very careful.
\end{remark}



\subsection{Internal/Thermal Energy}

As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:thermal-energy-definition}, internal energy, or
thermal energy ($U$) is the total kinetic and potential energies of the
atoms/molecules at the molecular level. To calculate the thermal energy of a
collection of molecules, we first note the average kinetic energy of an
ideal-gas molecule. A molecule can translate in three dimensions (its velocity
can have the $\hat x$, $\hat y$ and $\hat z$ components), so kinetic energy
can be equally divided amongst the three ``degrees of freedom'' (DoF):
\begin{equation*}
  \expval K=\frac12m\expval{v^2}=\frac12m\expval{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}
  =\frac12m\expval{v_x^2}+\frac12m\expval{v_y^2}+\frac12m\expval{v_z^2}
\end{equation*}
Since the motion of the molecules is entirely random (i.e.\ there is no
preferred direction of motion), the component averages must be the same, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
  \expval{v_x^2}=\expval{v_y^2}=\expval{v_z^2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}
  \textbf{Equipartition theorem:} %Since the motion is random,
  The internal energy of a thermodynamic system must be evenly divided between
  each degrees of freedom (DoF). Each DoF has a contribution of
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac12Nk_BT\quad\text{\normalsize or}\quad\frac12nRT
  \end{equation*}
  towards the total internal energy of the system
\end{definition}

\textbf{Monatomic gases} (e.g.\ helium, argon gases) have 3 translational DoF,
therefore the internal energy is the total kinetic energy, which were shown
earlier:
\begin{equation}
  U=\frac32Nk_BT=\frac32nRT
\end{equation}
\textbf{Diatomic gases} (e.g.\ hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen)
%\footnote{In
%  %\footnote{By definition, diatomic gases cannot also
%  %be ideal gases. However, in
%  AP Physics 2, you will often hear of a ``diatomic ideal gas''. In those
%  cases, we assume an equality rather than an approximation}
have 3 translational DoF, and 2 rotational DoF, therefore the total internal
energy is:
\begin{equation}
  U=\frac52Nk_BT=\frac52nRT
\end{equation}
\textbf{Solids} typically have 3 translational DoF, plus 3 vibrational DoF in
elastic compression, and therefore the internal energy is:
\begin{equation}
  U\approx3Nk_BT\quad\text{\normalsize or}\quad 3nRT
\end{equation}
It should be noted that the above approximation is more accurate for solids
that have well-defined lattice-crystalline structures (e.g.\ metals and their
alloys). For other substances, this approximation can be \emph{very}
inaccurate.

What is conspicuously missing is the description of liquids. In general, there
is no viable approximation for the internal energy of a liquid because of the
complexity. However, regardless of whether a substance is a gas, liquid or a
solid, the internal energy is always proportional to absolute temperature:
\begin{equation}
  U\propto T
\end{equation}
Therefore we can observe changes in the internal energy by measuring how (and
by how much) temperature is changing.



\subsection{Heat}
\label{sec:heat-transfer}

\textbf{Heat} ($Q$) is the spontaneous non-mechanical transfer of energy
\emph{into} the system, through conduction, convection and radiation. In other
words, heat transfer is work done at the molecular level. By the sign
convention used in this book, heat transfer is:
\begin{itemize}
\item $+$ if heat is added to the system
\item $-$ if heat leaves the system
\end{itemize}
By the second law of thermodynamics, the net heat transfer is always from the
higher temperature to low temperature. Two objects are in thermal equilibrium
(zero net heat transfer) if the temperature of both objects are the same.

\textbf{Conduction:}

\textbf{Convection:}

\textbf{Radiation:}



\subsection{Mechanical Work}

{\color{orange}$W$} is the mechanical work%\footnote{The full
%    definition in calculus form is $W=\int PdV$ (i.e.\ pressure times change in
%    volume) which is derived from the definition of mechanical work:
%    $W=\int\bm F\cdot d\bm x$ (force times distance)} done \emph{to}
%  the system by the surrounding.

\section{Heat Capacity}

In many situations, heat transferred from a thermodynamic system ($Q$) can be
directly related to the change in temperature ($\Delta T$) by the object's
\textbf{heat capacity} ($C$):
\begin{important-equation}
  Q = C\Delta T
\end{important-equation}
$C$ is the amount of energy required to heat up the substance by \SI1{\kelvin}
or \SI1{\celsius}. It has a unit of \emph{joule per kelvin}
(\si{\joule\per\kelvin}) or \emph{joule per degree Celsius}
(\si{\joule\per\celsius}). Heat capacity depends on the object's mass as well
as its composition.
%  It can be also expressed using a related quantity called the \textbf{molar
%    heat capacity}, which is the energy required to heat \SI1{\mol} of a
%  substance by \SI1\kelvin:
%
%  \eq{-.15in}{
%    \boxed{ Q = nc_m\Delta T }
%  }
However, more practically, we separate the substance from the amount of it.
The \textbf{specific heat capacity} (lower case $c$) is the energy required to
raise the temperature of \SI1{\kilo\gram} of a substance by \SI1{\kelvin} or
\SI1\celsius:
\begin{important-equation}
  Q = \underbracket[1pt]{mc}_C\Delta T
\end{important-equation}
$c$ is a physical property of a substance, with an SI unit of
\emph{joule per kilogram per kelvin} (\si{\joule\per\kilo\gram.\kelvin})



\subsection{Specific Heat Capacity for Solids}

When heat is added or removed from a solid, usually little to no work is done
\emph{by} the solid (i.e.\ $W\approx 0$). Therefore all the heat transfer goes
into changing the internal energy:
\begin{equation}
  Q\approx\Delta U\approx\underbracket[1pt]{3nR}_{mc}\Delta T
\end{equation}
%  The molar heat capacity is approximately the same for \emph{most} solids.
%  Note that the universal gas constant still makes an appearance!
%
%  \eq{-.15in}{
%    c_m\approx\frac Cn=3R
%  }
And the specific heat capacity can be obtained by:
%$m=nM$ from the heat capacity:
\begin{equation}
  c\approx\frac{3nR}m\quad\rightarrow\quad c\approx\frac{3R}M
\end{equation}
This approximation applies best to substances that have a well-defined lattice
structure (e.g.\ metals), but may be \emph{very} inaccurate non-metallic
substances. In general, $c$ is determined experimentally.




\subsection{Heat Capacities for Gases at Constant Volume}

For gases, the value for heat capacities depends on whether work is also done
when heat is added/removed from the gas. When heat is added/removed at
\emph{constant volume}, no work is done, therefore all the heat goes into
changing the internal energy. For monatomic or ideal gases:
\begin{equation}
  Q=\Delta U={\color{magenta}\frac32nR}\Delta T=
  {\color{magenta}mc_v}\Delta T\quad\rightarrow\quad
  c_v=\frac{3nR}{2m}=\frac{3R}M
\end{equation}
while for diatomic gases:
\begin{equation}
  Q=\Delta U\approx{\color{cyan}\frac52nR}\Delta T
  ={\color{cyan}mc_v}\Delta T=\quad\rightarrow\quad
  c_v\approx\frac{5nR}{2m}=\frac{5R}{2M}
\end{equation}




%{Heat Capacities of Gases at Constant Volume}
%  The molar heat capacity of a gas is therefore:
%
%  \begin{equation}
%    c_m=\frac{C_v}n=\frac32R\quad\text{(ideal)}\quad\quad
%    c_m=\frac{C_v}n\approx\frac52R\quad\text{(diatomic)}
%  }
%
%  And the specific heat capacities for ideal/monatomic and diatomic gases are,
%  respectively:
%
%  \begin{equation}
%    c_v=\frac{C_v}m=\frac32\frac RM\quad\text{(ideal)}\quad\quad
%    c_v=\frac{C_v}m\approx\frac52\frac RM\quad\text{(diatomic)}
%  }



\subsection{Heat Capacities of Gases at Constant Pressure}

When heat is added/removed at \emph{constant pressure}, volume changes, and
work is done by/to the gas. This work can be related to temperature change
using the ideal gas law:
\begin{equation}
  W=-P\Delta V = -nR\Delta T
\end{equation}
The heat added is therefore
\begin{equation}
  Q=\Delta U - W =mc_v\Delta T + nR\Delta T
  %\quad\rightarrow\quad
  %\boxed{c_p=c_v+nR}
\end{equation}
%  which means that heat capacities are:
%
%  \eq{-.15in}{
%    C_p=\frac52nR\quad\text{(ideal)}\quad\quad
%    C_p\approx\frac72nR\quad\text{(diatomic)}
%  }

%  The molar heat capacity of a gas at constant pressure is therefore:
%
%  \begin{equation}
%    c_m=\frac52R\quad\text{(ideal)}\quad\quad
%    c_m\approx\frac72R\quad\text{(diatomic)}
%  }
which means that the specific heat capacity is:
\begin{equation}
  c_p=\frac52\frac RM\quad\text{(ideal)}\quad\quad
  c_p\approx\frac72\frac RM\quad\text{(diatomic)}
\end{equation}
The actual specific heat capacities of different substances are usually found
experimentally

\section{Phase Change}

%{Fundamental Phases}
We generally understand that there are four natural fundamental states of
matter: \textbf{solid}, \textbf{liquid}, \textbf{gas} and \textbf{plasma}

%
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Which phase change can occur depends on pressure and temperature.
%    \item For example, water in its liquid form cannot exist below
%      \SI{.6}{\kilo\pascal}, and so adding enough energy to ice will directly
%      change it to water vapour
%    \item At \textbf{triple point} (B), the liquid, gas and solid phases can
%      exist in thermal equilibrium
%    \item At \textbf{critical point} (C), the liquid and gas phases become
%      indistinguisheable
%    \item Beyond (C), the matter is considered to be a \emph{supercritical
%    fluid}
%    \end{itemize}


During phase change, heat is either added or taken away from a substance, but
the temperature does not change. This is a heating curve for water at
atmospheric pressure:
%  \begin{center}
%    \pic{.6}{heating-curve}
%  \end{center}
%  The mechanics of phase transition is \emph{very} complex, and beyond the
%  scope of this course.



\subsection{Latent Heat}

\textbf{Specific latent heat} is the heat required to change the phase of
\SI1{\kilo\gram} of a substance. Here, we are only concerned with
\textbf{specific latent heat of fusion} $L_f$ (for melting and freezing) and
\textbf{specific latent heat of vapourization} $L_v$ (vapourization and
condensation).
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{Q = mL_f} \quad\quad \boxed{Q = mL_v}
\end{equation}
During phase change, the temperature will remain constant. Specific latent heat

\section{Quasi-Static Processes}

To show the work by a gas, and how the state of the gas changes, we can plot
the pressure vs.\ the volume of the gas, called a $P$-$V$ diagram, as the state
changes. The mechanical work $W$ is the area under the curve: $W<0$ (work done
\emph{by} the system) if the path moves towards the right, while $W>0$ (work
done \emph{to} the system) if the path moves towards the left. In the examples
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PV1}, the gas is changed from the same states (1 to 2),
but the mechanical work done is different.

The fact that $W$ is \emph{path dependent} means that the force exerted by the
gas $F=P\cdot A$ is non-conservative (it may be obvious to you already).

A \textbf{quasi-static process} is a thermodynamic process that happens slowly
enough for the system to remain in internal equilibrium.

We are concerned with four of these processes:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=6pt]
\item\textbf{Isobaric process} (Fig.~\ref{fig:isobaric}
  constant pressure\footnote{If you don't know
  already, a ``bar'' is a measurement of pressure, where
  $\SI1{bar}=\SI{10e5}{\pascal}$}
\item\textbf{Isochoric process} is a process in which the volume remains
  constant. There is no work done to or by the gas during this process
  ($W=0$), therefore all the heat that goes into and out of the system will
  only change the internal energy of the system, i.e.:
  \begin{equation*}
    \Delta U = Q
  \end{equation*}
\item\textbf{Isothermal process} is a process in which the temperature remains
  constant. There is no change in the internal energy of the gas
  ($\Delta U=0$); all the heat that goes into the gas is accounted for by the
  work done, i.e.:
  \begin{equation*}
    Q=-W
  \end{equation*}
\item\textbf{Adiabatic process}--``isolated'', no heat exchanged with
  surrounding, therefore $Q=0$.
\end{itemize}

%{Efficiency of Heat Engine}
%  In a heat engine, the internal energy at the beginning and end of the cycle
%  are the same (same point on the $P$-$V$ diagram), so the work done is just
%  the difference between heat added and taken out:
%  
%  \eq{-.25in}{
%    W = Q_\text{in}-Q_\text{out}
%  }
%  
%  Efficiency is defined as the ratio between work done and heat added:
%
%  \begin{equation}
%    \boxed{\eta =\frac W{Q_\text{in}}=1-\frac{Q_\text{out}}{Q_\text{in}}}
%  }
%
%
%
%
%%{Second Law of Thermodynamics}
%%  \begin{block}{Kelvin-Planck Statement}
%%    It is impossible for heat engine working in a cycle to produce no other
%%    effect than that of extracting heat from a reservoir and performing an
%%    equivalent amount of work.
