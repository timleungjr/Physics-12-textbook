%  travel underwater to detection devices located around the planet. Explain how
%  this works in terms of the physics of sound. Some questions to consider:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item How does this help them determine the temperature of the ocean?
%  \item What property of waves do they utilize and how does this property
%    change as it travels through different parts of the world's oceans?
%  \item If the ocean was really warming up how would their observations at the
%    detectors change?
%  \end{itemize}
%  \vspace{2in}

\item When a violin string is played without fingering simultaneously
  with a tuning fork of frequency \SI{440}\hertz, beats are heard at a rate
  of 3 per second. When the tension in the string is increased slightly, the
  beat frequency decreases. What was the initial frequency of the violin string?

  \item The G string on a violin is \SI{30}{\centi\metre} long. When played
  without fingering (violinists call it an ``open string''), it vibrates at a
  fundamental frequency of \SI{196}{\hertz}. The next higher note on a G-major
  scale is A (\SI{220}\hertz). %and B (\SI{247}{\hertz}).
  How far from the end of the string must a finger be placed to play that note?
  
  \item The normal range of hearing of an average adult is about 20 to
  \SI{20000}\hertz.

    \item What is the greatest length of an organ pipe that would have its
    fundamental note in this range if it is closed at one end? Assume a speed
    of sound of \SI{340}{\metre\per\second} at room temperature.

    \item The shortest pipes in organs are about \SI{7.5}{\centi\metre} long.
    What is the fundamental frequency of a pipe if it is open at both ends?

    \item For the \SI{7.5}{\centi\metre} organ pipe, what is the highest
    harmonic that is within the audible range?
  \end{enumerate}  
  %What are the frequencies if the temperature is raised to \SI{28}\celsius?
  
%  \item A student carefully makes the following observations listening for
%  the resonance points from a tuning fork vibrating above an adjustable length
%  pipe that is open on one end:
%  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
%    \item Temperature is \SI{13.3}\celsius
%    \item First resonant length: $L_1=\SI{8.3}{\centi\metre}$
%  \end{itemize}
%  Then he rushes his following measurements for additional resonance points
%  to finish the lab:
%  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
%  \item Second resonance length $L_2=\SI{25}{\centi\metre}$
%  \item Third resonance length $L_3=\SI{58}{\centi\metre}$
%  \end{itemize}
%  \begin{enumerate}
%    \item Draw diagrams (waveform inside the pipe) for the first two
%    resonant lengths collected.
%    \item Find the frequency of the unknown tuning fork.
%    \item Analyze all the data to see if he made any errors in their collection
%    of observations. If he has made an error, what is it?
%  \end{enumerate}

\item Three successive resonance frequencies in an organ pipe are 1310,
  1834, and \SI{2358}\hertz. Is the pipe closed at one end or open at both
  ends? What is the fundamental frequency? What is the length of the pipe if the
  speed of sound is \SI{340}{\metre\per\second}?
  
  %\item Describe what you would see when a standing wave was set up in a
  % spring. Why is it called a standing wave?

  %\item What is a node? What is an anti-node? Describe how the nodes and
  %anti-nodes are distributed along the length of the standing wave pattern.

  %\item A skyscraper will often oscillate due to wind blowing against it
  %(gusting). It vibrates like a semi-open pipe in fundamental mode (node at the
  %bottom of the building, anti-node at the top). Engineers calculate that the
  %transverse waves will travel through the structure at a speed of
  %\SI{45}{\meter\per\second}. For a wind that typically gusts with a period of
  %\SI{12.0}\second, what height of the building will vibrate the most?
  %\vspace{\stretch1}
  
  %\item A clarinet behaves like a semi-open pipe with the open end at the
  %bell and closed end at the reed. Claudia blows very gently---just enough to
  %play a low A with a frequency of \SI{220}\hertz. She then blows harder
  %(overblows) using the same fingering and produce the next higher note (the
  %next resonance mode). What is the frequency of the higher note? Can you
  %determine its pitch?

  %\item The sound of a starting pistol can be heard easily from a distance
  %of \SI{800}{\metre} but the smoke can be seen much sooner than the sound is
  %perceived. Why is the smoke seen before the sound is heard? What is the time
  %delay for the sound of the pistol if the air temperature is
  %\SI{15}\celsius?

  %\items A general rule for finding the distance to a lightning flash is to
  %begin counting when the flash is observed and stop when the thunder clap is
  %heard. The number of seconds counted is then divided by 3 to get the distance
  %in kilometres. Why is this justified? How accurate is this procedure? Is a
  %correction for the time is takes for the light to reach you important? (The
  %speed of light is \SI{3e8}{\metre\per\second}.)
  
  %\item You decide to create a jug and bottle band where you want to play
  %the bottles and jugs by blowing across the tops of the bottles to generate
  %sounds. What is the largest/longest container you will need based on the
  %human range of hearing? What is the shortest? Are these reasonable jug sizes?
  %Illustrate your explanation with a diagram. (Human can hear approximately
  %from \SI{20}{\hertz} to \SI{20000}\hertz.)

  %\item An organ pipe open at one end and closed at the other is
  %\SI{30}{\centi\metre} long. If the temperature in the church is
  %\SI{30}\celsius, what is the fundamental frequency and the second resonance
  %of the pipe?
  
  %\item Most organ pipes are open at one end and closed at the other, and
  %their lengths are traditionally measured in \emph{feet} (i.e.\ ``\SI8{ft}'',
  %``\SI4{ft}'' etc.) One particular church organ uses a semi-open \SI{16}{ft}
  %pipe. If the temperature in the church is \SI{20}\celsius,
  %\begin{enumerate}
  %  \item What is the fundamental frequency of that pipe?
  %  \item What is the second resonance frequency?
  %  \item Why are there no pipes that are longer than \SI{16}{ft}?
  %\end{enumerate}
  %%Are these frequencies audible?
  %(Hint: Unit conversion is important!)

  %\item Consider a standing wave on a guitar string tuned to
  %\SI{440}\hertz.
  %\begin{enumerate}
  %  \item Draw the first two harmonics and compute their frequencies
  %  \item Indicate the location(s) of all the nodes and anti-nodes.
  %  \item Describe how nodes and anti-nodes are distributed along the length of
  %  the standing wave pattern.
  %\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
