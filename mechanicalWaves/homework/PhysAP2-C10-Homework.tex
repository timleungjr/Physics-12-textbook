\item The figure above on the left shows a uniformly thick rope hanging
  vertically from an oscillator that is turned off. When the oscillator is on
  and set at a certain frequency, the rope forms the standing wave shown above
  on the right. $P$ and $Q$ are two points on the rope.

  \item The tension at point $P$ is greater than the tension at point $Q$.
    Briefly explain why.
    
  \item A student hypothesizes that increasing the tension in a rope increases
    the speed at which waves travel along the rope. In a clear, coherent
    paragraph-length response that may also contain figures and/or equations,
    explain why the standing wave shown above supports the student’s hypothesis.

  \item Two dots have been painted on the string. In the diagrams below, those
    dots are labeled $P$ and $Q$.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The figure below shows the string at an instant in time. At the
      instant shown, dot $P$ has maximum displacement and dot $Q$ has zero
      displacement from equilibrium. At each of $P$ and $Q$, draw an arrow
      indicating the direction of the instantaneous velocity of that dot. If
      either dot has zero velocity, write ``$v=0$'' next to the dot.

    \item The figure below shows the string at the same instant as shown in
      part (\ref{parta})i. At each of $P$ and $Q$, draw an arrow indicating the
      direction of the instantaneous acceleration of that dot. If either dot
      has zero acceleration, write ``$a=0$'' next to the dot.

    The figure below represents the string at time $t=0$, the same instant as
    shown in part (\ref{parta}) when dot $P$ is at it maximum displacement
    from equilibrium. For simplicity, dot $Q$ is not shown.

\item The figure above shows a string with one end attached to an oscillator
  and the other end attached to a block. The string passes over a massless
  pulley that turns with negligible friction. Four such strings, $A$, $B$, $C$,
  and $D$, are set up side by side, as shown in the diagram below. Each
  oscillator is adjusted to vibrate the string at its fundamental frequency
  $f$. The distance between each oscillator and pulley $L$ is the  same, and
  the mass $M$ of each block is the same. However, the fundamental frequency of
  each string is different.

  The equation for the velocity $v$ of a wave on a string is
  $v=\sqrt{\dfrac{F_T}{m/L}}$, where $F_T$ is the tension of the string and
  $m/L$ is the mass per unit length (linear mass density) of the string.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is different about the four strings shown above that would result
    in their having different fundamental frequencies? Explain how you arrived
    at your answer.
    
  \item A student graphs frequency as a function of the inverse of the linear
    mass density. Will the graph be linear? Explain how you arrived at your
    answer.
    
  \item The frequency of the oscillator connected to string $D$ is changed so
    that the string vibrates in its second harmonic. On the side view of string
    $D$ below, mark and label the points on the string that have the greatest
    average vertical speed.
