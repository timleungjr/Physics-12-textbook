%{Capacitors}
\textbf{Capacitors} is a device that stores energy in an electric field. The
simplest form of a capacitor is a set of closely spaced parallel plates:
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \pic{.45}{capacitors/cap19}
\end{figure}

When the plates are connected to a battery, the battery transfer charges to the
plates until the voltage $V$ equals the battery terminals. After that, one
plate has charge $+Q$; the other has $-Q$.


\section{Parallel-Plate Capacitors}
The (uniform) electric field between two parallel plates is proportional to the
surface charge density $\sigma$, which is the charge $Q$ divided by the area of
the plates $A$:
\begin{equation*}
  E=\frac{\color{red}\sigma}{\epsilon_0}=
  \frac{\color{red}Q}{{\color{red}A}\epsilon_0}
\end{equation*} 
Substituting this into the relationship between the plate voltage $V$ and
electric field, we find a relationship between the charges across the plates
and the voltage:
\begin{equation*}
  V={\color{blue}E}d=
  \frac{\textcolor{blue}{Q}d}{\textcolor{blue}{A\epsilon_0}}
  \quad\longrightarrow\quad
  \boxed{Q=\left[\frac{A\epsilon_0}d\right]V}
\end{equation*}
Since area $A$, distance of separation $d$ and the vacuum permittivity
$\epsilon_0$ are all constants, the relationship between charge $Q$ and voltage
$V$ is \emph{linear}. And the constant is called the \textbf{capacitance} $C$,
defined as:
\begin{important-equation}
  C=\frac QV
\end{important-equation}
For parallel plates:
\begin{important-equation}
  C=\frac{A\epsilon_0}d
\end{important-equation}
The unit for capacitance is a \textbf{farad} (named after Michael Faraday),
where $\SI1\farad=\SI1{\coulomb\per\volt}$.




\section{Cylindrical Capacitors}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \pic{.7}{capacitors/cylindrical-capacitor}
\end{figure}

Not all capacitors are parallel plates. Cylindrical capacitors are also popular.
\begin{itemize}
\item The capacitor has length $\ell$ which is much larger than the radii
  of the inner \& outer cylinders ($a$, $b$)
\item Inner cylinder has total charge $Q$
\item Outer cylinder has total charge $-Q$
\item Inside the capacitor, the electric field in the radial direction
\item Outside of the capacitor, there is no electric field
\end{itemize}


Using a bit of calculus, we can also see that, like the parallel plate, the
relationship between voltage and charge is still linear. In this case, the
capacitance is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  C=\frac QV=\frac{2\pi\ell\epsilon_0}{\ln(b/a)}
\end{equation}
%    The capacitance is generally expressed in terms of $C/\ell$. Capacitance
%    depends only on the geometry (i.e.\ the raidii $a$ and $b$) and the
%    permittivity.



\section{Practical Capacitors}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \pic{.35}{capacitors/Figure_20_05_05a}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel-plate capacitors are very common in electric circuits, but the
  vacuum between the plates is not very effective
\item Instead, a non-conducting \textbf{dielectric} material is inserted
  between the plates
\item When the plates are charged, the electric field of the plates polarizes
  the dielectric
\item The polarization  produces an electric field that opposes the field from
  the plates, therefore reduces the effective voltage, and increasing the
  capacitance
\end{itemize}




\section{Dielectric Constant}

If electric field without dielectric is $E_0$, then $E$ in the dielectric is
reduced by $\kappa$, the \textbf{dielectric constant}:
\begin{important-equation}
  \kappa=\frac{E_0}E
\end{important-equation}
The capacitance of the plates with the dielectric is now amplified by the
same factor $\kappa$:
\begin{important-equation}
  C_\text{eff}=\kappa C_0
\end{important-equation}
We can also view the dielectric as something that increases the
\textbf{effective permittivity}:
\begin{important-equation}
  \epsilon_\text{eff}=\kappa\epsilon_0
\end{important-equation}



%{Dielectric Constant}
The dielectric constants of commonly used materials are:
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    \rowcolor{pink}
    \textbf{Material} & $\kappa$ \\ \hline
    Air         & \num{1.00059} \\
    Bakelite    & \num{4.9} \\
    Pyrex glass & \num{5.6} \\
    Neoprene    & \num{6.9} \\
    Plexiglas   & \num{3.4} \\
    Polystyrene & \num{2.55} \\
    Water (\SI{20}\celsius) & \num{80} 
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}



\section{Storage of Electrical Energy}
%  When charging up a capacitor, imagine positive charges moving from the
%  ($-$) plate to the ($+$) plate.
%  \begin{center}c
%    \pic{.4}{slide14}
%  \end{center}
%  Initially neither plates are charged, so moving the first charge takes very
%  little work; as the electric field builds, more work needs to be done.
%  The total work done is the potential energy inside the capacitor:
\begin{important-equation}
  U_c=\frac12\frac{Q^2}C=\frac12QV=\frac12CV^2
\end{important-equation}



\begin{itemize}
\item The presence of a dielectric \emph{increases} the capacitance; therefore
  the work (and potential energy stored) to move a charge \emph{decreases}
  with the dielectric constant $\kappa$
\item After the capacitor is charged, removing the dielectric material from
  the capacitor plates will require additional work.
\end{itemize}



\section{Capacitors in Electric Circuits}
Capacitors are an important part of an electric circuits because it stores
energy in the electric field
\begin{itemize}
\item Denoted by this symbol (with reference to the parallel-plate capacitor):

      \draw[thick] (3,0) to[C,o-o] (5,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
\item Act like a voltage source
\item Unlike a battery, the voltage increases or decreases as the charge
  across the capacitor plates change.
\end{itemize}
