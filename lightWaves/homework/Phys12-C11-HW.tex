  % Tipler p.1009 Question 22  
  \question A silver coin sits on the bottom of a swimming pool that is
  \SI{4.0}{\metre} deep. A beam of light reflected from the coin emerges from
  the pool making a \ang{20} angle with respect to the water's surface and
  enters the
  eye of the observer. Draw a ray from the coin to the eye of the observer.
  Extend this ray, which goes from the water-air vertical line drawn through
  the coin, straight back until it intersects with the vertical line drawn
  through the coin. What is the apparent depth of the swimming pool to this
  observer?

%  % Tipler p.1010 Question 43
%  \question In the figure below, light is initially in a medium (such as air) of
%  refractive index $n_1$. It is incident at angle $\theta_1$ on the surface of
%  a liquid (such as water) of refractive index $n_2$. The light passes through
%  the layer of liquid and enters glass of refractive index $n_3$. If $\theta_3$
%  is the angle of  refraction in the glass, show that
%  $n_1\sin\theta_1=n_3\sin\theta_3$. That is, show that the second medium can be
%  neglected when finding the angle of refraction in the third medium.
