    \part If that E-string has a tension of \SI{82.3}\newton, what is the
    density ($\rho$) of the metal that the string is made of? Assume that the
    string is perfectly circular, with a radius of \SI{.27}{\milli\metre}.

  \question The figure above on the left shows a uniformly thick rope hanging
  vertically from an oscillator that is turned off. When the oscillator is on
  and set at a certain frequency, the rope forms the standing wave shown above
  on the right. $P$ and $Q$ are two points on the rope.
  \begin{parts}
    \part The tension at point $P$ is greater than the tension at point $Q$.
    Briefly explain why.
    \vspace{\stretch1}

    \part A student hypothesizes that increasing the tension in a rope increases
    the speed at which waves travel along the rope. In a clear, coherent
    paragraph-length response that may also contain figures and/or equations,
    explain why the standing wave shown above supports the studentâ€™s hypothesis.

      \subpart The figure below shows the string at an instant in time. At the
      instant shown, dot $P$ has maximum displacement and dot $Q$ has zero
      displacement from equilibrium. At each of $P$ and $Q$, draw an arrow
      indicating the direction of the instantaneous velocity of that dot. If
      either dot has zero velocity, write ``$v=0$'' next to the dot.

      \subpart The figure below shows the string at the same instant as shown in
      part (\ref{parta})i. At each of $P$ and $Q$, draw an arrow indicating the
      direction of the instantaneous acceleration of that dot. If either dot
      has zero acceleration, write ``$a=0$'' next to the dot.

  \question The figure above shows a string with one end attached to an
  oscillator and the other end attached to a block. The string passes over a
  massless pulley that turns with negligible friction. Four such strings, $A$,
  $B$, $C$, and $D$, are set up side by side, as shown in the diagram below.
  Each oscillator is adjusted to vibrate the string at its fundamental
  frequency $f$. The distance between each oscillator and pulley $L$ is the
  same, and the mass $M$ of each block is the same. However, the fundamental
  frequency of each string is different.
  \cpic{.65}{topview}

  The equation for the velocity $v$ of a wave on a string is
  $v=\sqrt{\dfrac{F_T}{m/L}}$, where $F_T$ is the tension of the string and
  $m/L$ is the mass per unit length (linear mass density) of the string.
  \begin{parts}
    \part What is different about the four strings shown above that would result
    in their having different fundamental frequencies? Explain how you arrived
    at your answer.
    \vspace{\stretch1}
    
    \part A student graphs frequency as a function of the inverse of the linear
    mass density. Will the graph be linear? Explain how you arrived at your
    answer.

    \newpage

    \part The frequency of the oscillator connected to string $D$ is changed so
    that the string vibrates in its second harmonic. On the side view of string
    $D$ below, mark and label the points on the string that have the greatest
    average vertical speed.
