  This is a conservation of energy problem, since gravity is a conservative
  force.

%  %\item The Apollo Project was the first to put American astronauts on the
%  %moon. In total, six spacecrafts landed the moon in the 1960s. During the
%  %mission, the Apollo ``Command Module'' (CM) would typically stay in an orbit
%  %\SI{110}{\kilo\metre} above the lunar surface.
%  %\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt]
%  %  \item Given the orbital altitude, how long would it take for the CM to
%  %  complete one orbit around the Moon? What is its speed in orbit?
%  %  
%  %  \item During the mission, the CM has to decrease its altitude to a mere
%  %  \SI{11}{\kilo\metre} orbit above the lunar surface so that the ``Lunar
%  %  Module'' (LM) can be safely detached from it. How much energy is released
%  %  during the descent? The combined mass of the CM and the CM is
%  %  \SI{28000}{\kilo\gram}.
%  %  \item How fast would the CM be moving at this low altitude?
%  %  \item In order to return to Earth, the CM needs to break free
%  %  from Moon's gravitational pull. What is the escape speed at this altitude?

%
%  \item As a member of the 2240 Olympic Committee, you are considering a new
%  sport: asteroid jumping. On Earth, world-class high jumpers routinely clear
%  \SI2\metre. Your job is to make sure athletes jumping from asteroids will
%  return to the asteroid. Make the simplifying assumption that asteroids are
%  spherical, with an average density of \SI{2.5e3}{\kilo\gram\per\metre\cubed}.
%  For safety, make sure that even a jumper capable of \SI3{\metre} on Earth
%  will return to the surface. What do you report for the minimum asteroid
%  diameter? \textbf{Answer to 3 significant figures.}

%  %\item In the past, when the space shuttle delivered a crew to the
%  %International Space Station (ISS), it usually boosts the orbit of the station
%  %from about \SI{370}{\kilo\metre} to \SI{400}{\kilo\metre}. How much energy
%  %does the shuttle add to the station's orbit? (The mass of the ISS is
%  %approximately \SI{4.2e5}{\kilo\gram}.)
