%  \question A wooden wheel of mass $M$, consisting of a rim with spokes, rolls
%  down a ramp that makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, as shown above.
%  The ramp exerts a force of static friction on the wheel so that the wheel
%  rolls without slipping.
%  \begin{parts}
%    \part On the diagram below, draw and label the forces (not components)
%    that act on the wheel as it rolls down the ramp, which is indicated by the
%    dashed line. To clearly indicate at which point on the wheel each force
%    is exerted, draw each force as a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing
%    away from, the point at which the force is exerted. The lengths of the
%    arrows need not indicate the relative magnitudes of the forces.

%    
%    \part As the wheel rolls down the ramp, which force causes a change in
%    the angular velocity of the wheel with respect to its centre of mass?
%    Briefly explain your reasoning.
%    \vspace{\stretch1}
%
%    \part For this ramp angle, the force of friction exerted on the wheel is
%    less than the maximum possible static friction force. Instead, the
%    magnitude of the force of static friction exerted on the wheel is 40
%    percent of the magnitude of the force or force component directed opposite
%    to the force of friction. Derive an expression for the linear acceleration
%    of the wheel's centre of mass in terms of $M$, $\theta$, and physical
%    constants, as appropriate.

%      negligible friction.

  \question A block of unknown mass is attached to a long, lightweight string
  that is wrapped several turns around a pulley mounted on a horizontal axis
  through its centre, as shown above. The pulley is a uniform solid disk of
  mass $M$ and radius $R$. The rotational inertia of the pulley is described by
  the equation $I=\dfrac12MR^2$. The pulley can rotate about its centre with
  negligible friction. The string does not slip on the pulley as the block
  falls.

  \vspace{.1in}When the block is released from rest and as the block travels
  towards the ground, the magnitude of the tension exerted on the block by the
  string is $F_T$.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Determine an expression for the magnitude of the angular acceleration
    $a_D$ of the disk as the block travels downwards. Express your answer in
    terms of $M$, $R$, $F_T$, and physical constants as appropriate.

      Scenarios 1 and 2 show two different pulleys. In Scenario 1, the pulley
      is the same solid disk referenced in part (a). In Scenario 2 , the pulley
      is a hoop that has the same mass $M$ and radius $R$ as the disk. Each
      pulley has a lightweight string wrapped around it several turns and is
      mounted on a horizontal axle, as shown. Each pulley is free to rotate
      about its centre with negligible friction.

      \vspace{.15in}In both scenarios, the pulleys begin at rest. Then both
      strings are pulled with the same constant force $F_A$ for the same time
      interval $\Delta t$, causing the pulleys to rotate without the string
      slipping. After time interval $\Delta t$, the change in angular momentum
      of the disk is equal to the change in angular momentum of the hoop, but
      the change in rotational kinetic energy for the disk is greater than that
      of the hoop.
    }
    \part Consider scenarios 1 and 2 at the end of time interval $\Delta t$. In
    a clear, coherent paragraph-length response that may also contain equations
    and drawings, explain why the change in angular momentum of both pulleys is
    the same but the change in rotational kinetic energy is greater for the
    disk.

  \question Two pulleys with different radii are attached to each other so that
  they rotate together about a horizontal axle through their common centre.
  There is negligible friction in the axle. Object 1 hangs from a light string
  wrapped around the larger pulley, while object 2 hangs from another light
  string wrapped around the smaller pulley, as shown in the figure above.
  
  $m_0$ is the mass of object 1.\\
  $1.5m_0$ is the mass of object 2.\\
  $r_0$ is the radius of the smaller pulley.\\
  $2r_0$ is the radius of the larger pulley.

    begin to accelerate.

      on the objects-pulleys system about the axle after the pulleys are
      released. Express your answer in terms of $m_0$, $r_0$, and physical
      constants, as appropriate.

    angular acceleration of the pulley compare to each other?
