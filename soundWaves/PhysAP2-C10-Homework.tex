  %\question A skyscraper will often oscillate due to wind blowing against it
  %(gusting). It vibrates like a semi-open pipe in fundamental mode (node at the
  %bottom of the building, anti-node at the top). Engineers calculate that the
  %transverse waves will travel through the structure at a speed of
  %\SI{45}{\meter\per\second}. For a wind that typically gusts with a period of
  %\SI{12.0}\second, what height of the building will vibrate the most?
  %\vspace{\stretch1}
  
  %\question A clarinet behaves like a semi-open pipe with the open end at the
  %bell and closed end at the reed. Claudia blows very gently---just enough to
  %play a low A with a frequency of \SI{220}\hertz. She then blows harder
  %(overblows) using the same fingering and produce the next higher note (the
  %next resonance mode). What is the frequency of the higher note? Can you
  %determine its pitch?

  %\question The sound of a starting pistol can be heard easily from a distance
  %of \SI{800}{\metre} but the smoke can be seen much sooner than the sound is
  %perceived. Why is the smoke seen before the sound is heard? What is the time
  %delay for the sound of the pistol if the air temperature is
  %\SI{15}\celsius?

  %\questions A general rule for finding the distance to a lightning flash is to
  %begin counting when the flash is observed and stop when the thunder clap is
  %heard. The number of seconds counted is then divided by 3 to get the distance
  %in kilometres. Why is this justified? How accurate is this procedure? Is a
  %correction for the time is takes for the light to reach you important? (The
  %speed of light is \SI{3e8}{\metre\per\second}.)
  
  %\question You decide to create a jug and bottle band where you want to play
  %the bottles and jugs by blowing across the tops of the bottles to generate
  %sounds. What is the largest/longest container you will need based on the
  %human range of hearing? What is the shortest? Are these reasonable jug sizes?
  %Illustrate your explanation with a diagram. (Human can hear approximately
  %from \SI{20}{\hertz} to \SI{20000}\hertz.)

  %\question An organ pipe open at one end and closed at the other is
  %\SI{30}{\centi\metre} long. If the temperature in the church is
  %\SI{30}\celsius, what is the fundamental frequency and the second resonance
  %of the pipe?
  
  %\question Most organ pipes are open at one end and closed at the other, and
  %their lengths are traditionally measured in \emph{feet} (i.e.\ ``\SI8{ft}'',
  %``\SI4{ft}'' etc.) One particular church organ uses a semi-open \SI{16}{ft}
  %pipe. If the temperature in the church is \SI{20}\celsius,
  %\begin{parts}
  %  \part What is the fundamental frequency of that pipe?
  %  \part What is the second resonance frequency?
  %  \part Why are there no pipes that are longer than \SI{16}{ft}?
  %\end{parts}
  %%Are these frequencies audible?
  %(Hint: Unit conversion is important!)

  %\question Consider a standing wave on a guitar string tuned to
  %\SI{440}\hertz.

  %  \part Draw the first two harmonics and compute their frequencies
  %  \part Indicate the location(s) of all the nodes and anti-nodes.
  %  \part Describe how nodes and anti-nodes are distributed along the length of
  %  the standing wave pattern.
