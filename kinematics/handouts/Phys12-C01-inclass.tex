\begin{enumerate}
\item Passengers in a high-speed elevator feel as though they are being pressed
  heavily against the floor when the elevator starts moving up. After the
  elevator reaches its maximum speed, the feeling disappears.

\item Given the definition of an inertial frame of reference,
  is Earth an inertial frame of reference?

\item Change the following graph to a \emph{position-time}
  graph and an \emph{acceleration-time} graph. Assume the object's displacement
  is initially zero.

\item While hiking in the wilderness, you come to a cliff overlooking a river.
  A topographical map shows that the cliff is \SI{291}{\metre} high and the
  river is \SI{68.5}{\metre} wide at that point. You throw a rock directly
  forward from the top of the cliff, giving the rock a horizontal velocity of
  \SI{12.8}{\metre\per\second}.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item Did the rock make it across the river?
  \item With what velocity did the rock hit the ground or water?
  \end{enumerate}

\item A golfer hits the golf ball off the tee, giving it an initial velocity of
  \SI{32.6}{\metre\per\second} at an angle of \ang{65} with the horizontal. The
  green where the golf ball lands is \SI{6.30}{\metre} higher than the tee, as
  shown in the illustration. Find the time interval when the golf ball was in
  the air, and the distance to the green.\\

\item You are playing tennis with a friend on tennis courts
  that are surrounded by a \SI{4.8}{\metre} fence. You opponent hits the ball
  over the fence and you offer to retrieve it. You find the ball at a distance
  of \SI{12.4}{\metre} on the other side of the fence. You throw the ball at an
  angle of \ang{55.} with the horizontal, giving it an initial velocity of
  \SI{12.1}{\metre\per\second}. The ball is \SI{1.05}{\metre} above the ground
  when you release it. Did the ball go over the fence, hit the fence, or hit
  the ground before it reached the fence?

\item A player kicks a football for the opening kickoff. He
  gives the ball an initial velocity of \SI{29}{m/s} at an angle of \ang{69}
  with the horizontal. Neglecting friction, determine the ball's maximum height,
  hang time and range?
