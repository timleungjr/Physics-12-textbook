\section{Projectile Motion}

A \textbf{projectile} is an object that is launched through the air\footnote{Or
  more accurately, in a \emph{vaccum}!} along a parabolic trajectory and
accelerates only due to gravity. When solving projectile motion problems, we
usually define the axes in a way that is consistent with cartesian coordinate
system, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:projectile}, where:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item $x$-axis is the \emph{horizontal} direction, with the positive direction
  pointing \emph{forward}
\item $y$-axis is the \emph{vertical} direction, with the positive direction
  pointing \emph{up}
\item the origin of the coordinate system is located at the point where the
  projectile is launched
\end{itemize}
%The initial velocity has both horizontal and vertical components.

  \label{fig:projectile}
\end{figure}
%In this case, the $x$ and $y$ components of velocity are defined as:
%\begin{align*}
%  v_x   &=V_i\cos\theta\\
%  v_{y1}&=V_i\sin\theta
%\end{align*}

In the \textbf{horizontal} ($x$) direction, there is no acceleration (i.e.\
$a_x=0$), therefore the horizontal velocity component is constant. Assuming
that the projectile is launched forward with an initial speed $V_i$ at an angle
of $\theta$ above the horizontal, the kinematic equations reduce to a single
equation:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta x=u_i\Delta t=V_i\cos\theta\Delta t
  \label{horizontal}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta x$ is the final horizontal displacement when motion stops,
$V_i$ is the initial speed (magnitude of the initial velocity),
$u_i=V_i\cos\theta$ is therefore the horizontal component of the
initial velocity (which is constant), and $\Delta t$ is the time of motion.

In the \textbf{vertical} ($y$) direction, there is a constant acceleration due
to gravity alone (i.e.\ $a_y=-g=\SI{-9.81}{\metre\per\second\squared}$).
Acceleration is \emph{negative} because the convention is to point the positive
axis upwards. The kinematic equations now take the form:
\begin{align}
  \Delta y &= v_i\Delta t - \frac12 g\Delta t^2
  = V_i\sin\theta\Delta t - \frac12 g\Delta t^2\label{vertical}\\
  v_f &= V_i\sin\theta -g\Delta t\\
  v_f^2 &= V_i^2\sin^2\theta-2g\Delta y\label{height}
\end{align}
where $v_i=V_i\sin\theta$ is the initial vertical component of velocity
(positive if $\theta$ above horizontal, and negative if $\theta$ is below), and
$\Delta y$ is the final vertical displacement (positive if the object lands
higher, then $\Delta y > 0$, if it lands lower, then $\Delta y<0$.)
%and $v_ In the equations above, we usethe acceleration in the $y$
%direction to be $a_y=-g=\SI{-9.81}{\metre\per\second}$. The acceleration is
%\emph{negative} since we usually define the positive direction to be \emph{up}.

Horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other, but there are
variables that are shared in both directions (Eqs.\ref{horizontal} and
\ref{vertical}), namely:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item Time interval $\Delta t$
\item Launch angle $\theta$
\item Initial speed $V_i$
\end{itemize}
When solving any projectile motion problems, there will be likely \emph{two}
equations with \emph{two} unknowns that you need to solve for. It is almost
certain that $\Delta t$ will be one of them. For more complicated problems,
where an object lands on a ramp, there will be a third relationship between
the horizontal displacement $\Delta x$ with vertical displacement $\Delta y$.



\subsection{Symmetric Trajectory}

A \textbf{symmetric trajectory} is a special case where an object is launched
at an angle of $\theta$ (between $\ang{0}$ and $\ang{90}$) above
horizontal\footnote{This may be obvious, but any angles \emph{below} the 
horizontal will never have a symmetric trajectory.} with an initial speed
$V_i$, and then lands at the same height. Examples may include hitting a golf
ball towards the hole, or shooting a bullet towards a horizontal
target\footnote{Shooting a bullet towards a horizontal target always require an
upward angle because of gravity}. To derive the equations, we use the $x$-axis
for the horizontal direction and $y$-axis for the vertical.

\subsubsection*{Maximum height}
The maximum height $H$ that the symmetric projectile by applying the kinematic
equation in the $y$-direction. Recognizing that at maximum height $H=\Delta y$,
vertical component of velocity is zero $v_{y2}=0$. Substituting this into
Eq.~\ref{height}:
\begin{equation}
  0 = (V_i\sin\theta)^2-2gH
\end{equation}
Solving for $H$, we get the maximum height equation:
\begin{important-equation}
  H=\frac{V_i^2\sin^2\theta}{2g}\quad\quad\quad\text{(for symmetric trajectory)}
\end{important-equation}

\subsubsection*{Total time of flight}
The total time of flight $T$ is calculated by applying the kinematic equation
in the $y$ (vertical) direction. When the object lands at the same height, the
final vertical displacement is zero. We can set $\Delta y=0$ and $T=\Delta t$ in
Eq.~\ref{vertical}:
\begin{equation*}
  0 = V_i\sin\theta T - \frac12 gT^2
\end{equation*}
Solving for $T$, we have:
\begin{important-equation}
  T=\frac{2V_i\sin\theta}g\quad\quad\quad\text{(for symmetric trajectory)}
  \label{tmax}
\end{important-equation}

\subsubsection*{Range}
To calculate the range of the projectile $R$, we substitute the expression for
$T$ from Eq.~\ref{tmax} into the $\Delta t$ in Eq.~\ref{horizontal}, the range
$R=\Delta x$ can be calculated for any given launch angle and initial speed:
\begin{equation*}
  R = V_i\cos\theta\left(\frac{2V_i\sin\theta}g\right)
\end{equation*}
Using the trigonometric identity $\sin(2\theta)=2\sin\theta\cos\theta$, we
simplify the equation to:
\begin{important-equation}
  R=\frac{V_i^2\sin(2\theta)}g
  \quad\quad\quad\text{(for symmetric trajectory)}
\end{important-equation}
It is obvious that for any given initial speed $V_i$, the maximum range
$R_\text{max}$ occurs when $\sin(2\theta)=1$ (i.e.\ $\theta=\ang{45}$), with a
range of:
\begin{important-equation}
  R_\text{max}=\frac{V_i^2}g
  \quad\quad\quad\text{(for symmetric trajectory)}
\end{important-equation}
Also, for a known initial speed $V$ and range $R$, the launch angle $\theta$
is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \theta_1=\frac12\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{gR}{V_i^2}\right)
  }
\end{equation}
This angle is labelled $\theta_1$ because it is \emph{not} the only angle that
can reach this range. Recall that for any angle $\ang{0}<\phi<\ang{90}$, there
is also another angle where the $\sin$ are equal:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sin\phi=\sin(\ang{180}-\phi)
\end{displaymath}
Which means that for any $\theta_1$, there is also another angle $\theta_2$
where $2\theta=\ang{180}-2\theta$, or quite simply:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\theta_2=\ang{90}-\theta_1}
\end{equation}
