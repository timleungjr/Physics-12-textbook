  \question A Sky Screamer Extreme water slide at the West Edmonton Mall has a
  height of \SI{26}\metre. If a \SI{45}{\kilo\gram} child begins at the top of
  the slide with a speed of \SI{.50}{\metre\per\second},
  \begin{parts}
    \part What is her speed at the bottom of the slide, if friction can be
    neglected?
    \part If she only reaches a speed of \SI{60}{\kilo\metre\per\hour}, what
    fraction of energy was lost?
    \part After the child exits the water slide, the force exerted on her by the
    pool slows her to a stop in a distance of \SI{6.0}\metre. What is the work
    done by the the water?

  \question A \SI{250}{mL} cup of water is too hot to drink at \SI{85}\celsius,
  so it is poured into a \SI{415}{\gram} ceramic mug container at
  room temperature (\SI{20}\celsius). The mug contained \SI{50}{\gram} of ice at
  \SI{-10}{\celsius} when the water is poured. What is the final temperature of 
  the water? Assume that all the ice has melted, and that no heat is lost to the
  surroundings. The specific heat capacities of the ceramic cup, water, and ice
  are $c_\text{cup}=\SI{1085}{\joule\per\kilo\gram.\celsius}$,
  $c_\text{ice}=\SI{2090}{\joule\per\kilo\gram.\celsius}$, and
  $c_\text{water}=\SI{4186}{\joule\per\kilo\gram.\celsius}$ respectively. The
  density of water is $\rho=\SI{1000}{\kilo\gram\per\metre\cubed}$. (Conversion
  factor: $\SI1{\metre\cubed}=\SI{1000}L$)

%  stepped up to a potential difference of \SI{1.00e2}{\kilo\volt} for
%  transmission. If there is a \SI{.90}{\percent} loss of power due to
%  transmission, what is the total resistance in the transmission wire? Assume
%  there is no power loss in the transformer.

%  \question A power plant produces 1800 MW of power at a current of
%  \SI{30.}{\kilo\ampere}. The power is then stepped up to a voltage of
%  \SI{240}{\kilo\volt}. If the primary circuit used in the transformer has
%  100 windings, how many windings are used in the secondary circuit? Assume
%  there is no power loss in the transformer.

  %    voltage for each of the coil segments.

  %\question Two coils, $A$ and $B$, are placed in the same magnetic field. Coil
  %$A$ has twice as many coils as $B$, but the material used in coil $B$ has
  %half the resistance of the material used to make coil $A$. The number of
  %loops in a coil is directly proportional to the magnitude of the electric
  %current induced. Knowing this, determine which coil would have more current
  %if the magnetic field were to suddenly drop to zero.
