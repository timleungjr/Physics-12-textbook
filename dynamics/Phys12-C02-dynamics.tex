%\section[Intro]{Introduction}

Now that we can mathematically describe the motion of any object, we have to
be able describe \emph{what} causes motion, or more precisely,
\emph{what causes motion to change.}




\section{Laws of Motions}
The definitions given here are based on the original text by Newton in
\emph{Principia}, but with some wording replaced with modern physics
language\footnote{For example, Newton used the term \emph{the alteration of
motion} to describe the acceleration of the object.}

The first law of motion describes what happens when there are no forces act on
an object:
\begin{definition}
  \textbf{First law:} Every object remains at rest or in uniform motion, until
  there is a net external force acting on the object.
\end{definition}
In other words, when the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object is
zero, the object's velocity does not change. In other words, the three equations
below are equivalent:
\begin{equation*}
  \bm F_\text{net}=\sum\bm F=\bm 0
  \quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
  \bm v=\text{constant}
  \quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
  \bm a=\bm 0
\end{equation*}
%  \end{center}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item As long as an object moves in uniform motion, it must be that
%    $\bm F_\text{net}=\bm 0$
%  \item Examples:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item A spacecraft in ``deep space'' has no forces acting on it
%    \item A hockey puck sliding on very smooth ice has gravity and normal
%      force, but the net force is zero
%    \item A car travelling on a highway at \SI{100}{\kilo\metre\per\hour} has
%      many forces acting on it, but the net force is zero
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item In ``a state of equilibrium''
%  \end{itemize}

What is not stated explicitly by Newton is that the first law of motion is only
valid when the mass of the object is constant. In other words, the first law of
motion, as stated above, will \emph{not} work for:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=3pt]
\item A rocket expelling spent fuel as it is launched towards space
\item A train car collecting grain though its open top
\end{itemize}
Later in Chapter~\ref{chapter:momentum}, we will modify the first law of motion
to include objects with changing mass.


The secon law of motion addresses what happens when the forces acting on an
object is not balance, i.e.\ when the net force is not zero.

\begin{definition}
  \textbf{Second law:} The acceleration of an object is proportional to the
  sum of all forces (net force) acting on it; and is along the same
  direction as the net force.
\end{definition}
The second law states that the acceleration of an object is the directresult of
the imbalance of forces, and that the relationship is \emph{linear} (i.e.\ when
the net force is double, the acceleration also doubles).

The first two laws of motion can be summarized by perhaps one of the most
important and recognizable equations in physics:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\bm F_\text{net}=m\bm a}
\end{equation}
The \emph{proportionality} between the net force and the acceleration of the
object is its mass. In fact, mass is defined as the ratio between the magnitude
of the net force acting on an object and the magnitude of the resultant
acceleration:
\begin{equation}
  m=\frac{|\bm F_\text{net}|}{|\bm a|}
\end{equation}
As such, mass is an intrinsic property of an object, and the same net force on
the object will \emph{always} result in the same acceleration, regardless of
what the net force is composed of, and whether the object is on Earth, on the
Moon, or in deep space.

Both the first and second laws of moton, as stated by Newton, require that the
mass of the object be constant. 




The third law of motion deals with the interaction between objects when forces
are created, and how objects apply forces on each other:
\begin{definition}
  \textbf{Third Law:} To every action there is always opposed and equal
  reaction; the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always
  equal, and directed to contrary parts.
\end{definition}
Mathematically, we can write that the force object $A$  exerts on bbject $B$
($\bm F_{AB}$, the action force) is equal in magnitude but opposite in
direction to the force that object $B$ exerts on object $A$ ($\bm F_{BA}$, the
reaction force).
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\bm F_\text{AB} = -\bm F_\text{BA}}
  \label{eq:third-law}
\end{equation}
The negative sign in Eq.~\ref{eq:third-law} indicates that the forces are in
opposite direction. It must be noted that
\textbf{the action and reaction forces must act on \emph{different} objects}.

The implication of the laws of motion is that forces are always created in
pairs: it is impossible for one object to exert a force on another without also
simultaneously being acted on by the other object. In
Chapter~\ref{chapter:energy}, we will show that the third law of motion is
crucial in formulating, and understanding, the law of conservation of energy.
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:momentum}, we will show that the third law of motion
is, in fact, an application of the first law of motion.

%\begin{example}
%  Old-style television picture tubes and computer monitors use cathode ray
%  tubes, where light is produced when fast-moving electrons collide with
%  phosphor molecules on the surface of the screen. The electrons (mass
%  $m=\text{\SI{9.1e-31}{\kilo\gram}}$) are accelerated from rest in the
%  electron ``gun'' at the back of the vacuum tube. Find the velocity of an
%  electron when it exits the gun after experiencing an electric force of
%  \SI{5.8e-15}{\newton} over a distance of \SI{3.5}{\milli\metre}.
%\end{example}

\section{Common Forces}
%  \textbf{Force} is the interaction between the objects
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item When there is interaction, then forces are created
%  \item A ``push'' or a ``pull''
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  \vspace{.2in}There are two types of forces:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item\textbf{Contact forces} act between two objects that are in contact
%    with one another
%  \item\textbf{Non-contact forces} act between two objects without them
%    touching each other.
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Also called ``action-at-a-distance'' force
%    \end{itemize}
%  \end{itemize}
%
%
%
%
%\section{Forces}
%  Newton considered all forces acting at a single point of an object called the
%  centre of mass (``CM'')
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item The centre of mass is also called the centre of gravity (``CG'') if the
%    object is inside a uniform gravitational field\footnote{Gravitational field
%    is a topic that will be discussed in Class 7}
%  \item If the density of an object is constant, then the CM is also the
%    geometric centre (centroid) of the object
%  \end{itemize}
%%  \vspace{.2in}If the net force on an object is zero ($\sum\bm F=\bm{0}$)
%%  then the object is in a \emph{state of equilibrium}
%%  \begin{itemize}
%%  \item Dynamic equilibrium: the object is moving relative to us
%%  \item Static equilibrium: the object is not moving relative to us
%%  \end{itemize}




\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Gravitational force ($\bm F_g$)
\item Normal force ($\bm F_n$)
\item Static and kinetic friction ($\bm F_s$ and  $\bm F_k$)
\item Spring force ($\bm F_e$)
\item Tension ($\bm F_T$)
\item Fluid Resistance, or Drag ($\bm F_d$)
\item Applied force ($\bm F_a$)
\item Electrostatic force ($\bm F_q$, discussed in Unit 3)
\item Magnetic force ($\bm F_m$, discussed in Unit 3)
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Gravity}
\textbf{Gravity} is the mutual force of attraction between all massive objects.
The gravitational force that objects apply to each other can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\bm F_g=m\bm g}
\end{equation}
The gravitational force acts in the same direction as $\bm g$, the acceleration
due to gravity at the object's position. At or near the surface of Earth,
$\bm g=\text{\SI{9.81}{\metre\per\second\squared}}$ [down]. In fact, the
direction of $\bm g$ is how we \emph{define} the concept of ``down''. $\bm g$
is also known as the ``gravitational field''; will be discussed in depth in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:gravity}. If this is the only force that acts on an object,
its resulting motion is called \textbf{free fall}.

To be clear, by the third law of motion, any object that is subjected to the
gravitational pulled by Earth will also exert an equal and opposite force on
Earth. However, since Earth is much more massive, this force will have no
effect to Earth's motion.

\subsection{Normal Force}
\textbf{Normal force} $F_n$ is a force a surface exerts on another object
that it is in contact with. It is always \emph{perpendicular} to the contact
surface.\footnote{This is where the term \emph{normal} came from.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick] (-1,0)--(2.5,0);
    \draw[mass] rectangle (1.5,1);
    \fill (.75,.5) circle (2pt);
    \draw[vectors] (.75,.5)--+(0,-1) node[below]{$F_g$};
    \draw[vectors] (.75,.5)--+(0,1) node[above]{$F_n$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \hspace{.5in}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}[rotate=30]
      \draw[thick] (-1,0)--(2.5,0);
      \draw[mass] rectangle (1.5,1);
      \fill (.75,.5) circle (2pt);
      \begin{scope}[vectors]
        \draw[rotate around={-30:(.75,.5)}] (.75,.5)--+(0,-1)
        node[below]{$F_g$};
        \draw (.75,.5)--+(0,1) node[above]{$F_n$};
      \end{scope}
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
Regardless of whether the surface is horizontal or slanted, $F_n$ is always be
perpendicular to the surface. However, the \emph{magnitude} of the normal force
will change.




%%\section{Normal Force on an Incline}
%%  When an object sits on a stationary incline, normal force decreases.
%%  
%%    \centering
%%    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.9]

%%      \end{scope}
%%    \end{tikzpicture}
%%    
%%    \begin{itemize}
%%    \item $F_n=F_g\cos\theta$
%%    \item $F_g$ has a component along the ramp $F_g\sin\theta$ that
%%      wants to slide the block down.
%%    \item There may also be a friction force $F_f$ that opposes the motion
%%    \item If the incline is also accelerating, then we have to treat this
%%      problem as a connected-body problem (discussed later in this topic)
%%    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Friction}
\textbf{Friction} is force that opposes the sliding of two surface across one
another
\begin{itemize}
\item Always act in the direction opposite to motion or attempted motion
\item Two types: \emph{static friction} and \emph{kinetic friction}
\end{itemize}  
%  \begin{center}
%   \pic{.6}{graphics/friction}
%  \end{center}


\textbf{Static friction} is the resistive force between two surfaces when
there is no relative motion between them. It increases with increasing
applied force $F_a$. It is at maximum when the object is just about to move.
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    F_s \leq \mu_sF_n
  }
  \label{eq:static-friction}
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
    \rowcolor{pink}
    \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
    Magnitude of static friction   & $F_s$ & \si\newton \\
    Coefficient of static friction & $\mu_s$ & (no unit)\\
    Magnitude of normal force      & $F_n$ & \si\newton
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Equation~\ref{eq:static-friction} only deals with the \emph{magnitude} of the
force. A proper free-body diagram is required to express the direction of
$\bm F_s$
%  \begin{tikzpicture}[overlay]
%    \uncover<2>{
%      \node[text width=85,draw=violet,fill=violet!5,text=violet] (act) at
%      (-3.2,4) {Actual static friction};
%      \draw[axes,violet] (act)--+(3,0);
%      
%      \node[text width=100,draw=orange,fill=orange!5,text=orange] (max) at
%      (5.05,4) {Maximum static friction};
%      \draw[axes,orange] (max)--+(-3,0);
%    }
%  \end{tikzpicture}

\textbf{Kinetic friction} is the resistive force between two surfaces that
are moving relative to each other. It is (nearly) constant along the path of
movement as long as the normal force stays constant:
\begin{equation}  
  \boxed{F_k = \mu_kF_n}
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
    \rowcolor{pink}
    \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
    Magnitude of kinetic friction   & $F_k$   & \si{\newton}\\
    Coefficient of kinetic friction & $\mu_k$ & (no unit)\\
    Magnitude of normal force       & $F_n$   & \si{\newton}
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}    
$\mu_k$ is always lower than $\mu_s$, otherwise nothing will ever move:
\begin{equation}  
  \mu_k\leq\mu_s
\end{equation}

%  \begin{tikzpicture}[overlay]
%    \uncover<2>{
%      \node[text width=86,draw=magenta,fill=magenta!5,text=magenta] (act) at
%      (3.5,5) {Unlike static friction, this is an equality};
%      \draw[axes,magenta] (act) to[out=50,in=90] +(3.5,.25);
%    }
%  \end{tikzpicture}




\subsection{Tension in a Cable}
\textbf{Tension} is the force exerted on and by a cable, rope, or string.
\begin{itemize}
\item You can't push on a rope
\item Assume the cable/rope/string to be mass less
\item Force can change direction when used with pulleys
\end{itemize}
How do engineers determine the amount of tension needed for a specific object
(bridges, floors or light fixtures)?




\subsection{Spring Force}
The spring force $\bm F_e$ is the force that a compressed/stretched spring
exerts on the object connected to it. An \emph{ideal} spring obeys
\textbf{Hooke's law}:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \bm F_e=-k\bm x
  }
\end{equation}
$\bm F_e$ is in the opposite direction to the spring's displacement $\bm x$,
and is proportional to the amount of compression/stretching.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.8]
    \draw[mass] (5,.5) rectangle (6,1.5);
    \draw[thick,
      decoration={aspect=.6,segment length=5mm, amplitude=2.5mm, coil},
      decorate] (0,1)--(5,1);
    \fill[pattern=north east lines](-.2,0) rectangle (0,2);
    \draw[thick] (0,0)--(0,2);
    \fill[red] (5.5,1) circle (.06);
    \draw[vectors,red] (5.5,1)--(4,1) node[above]{$\bm F_e$};
    \draw[dashed] (3,0)--(3,2) node[above]{Equilibrium position};
    \draw[vectors] (3,.3)--(5,.3) node[midway,below]{$x$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \hspace{.2in}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.8]
    \draw[thick,gray!40,fill=gray!20] (5,.5) rectangle (6,1.5);
    \draw[thick,gray!20,
      decoration={aspect=.6,segment length=5mm, amplitude=2.5mm, coil},
      decorate] (0,1)--(5,1);
    \fill[pattern=north east lines] (-.2,0) rectangle(0,2);
    \draw[thick] (0,0)--(0,2);
    \fill[gray!30] (5.5,1) circle (.06);
    \draw[vectors,gray!30] (5.5,1)--(4,1) node[above]{$\bm F_e$};
    \draw[dashed] (3,0)--(3,2);
    \draw[vectors,gray!30] (3,.3)--(5,.3) node[midway,below]{$x$};
    \draw[mass] (1.5,.5) rectangle (2.5,1.5);
    \draw[thick,
      decoration={aspect=.3,segment length=1.5mm, amplitude=2.5mm, coil},
      decorate] (0,1)--(1.5,1);
    \draw[vectors] (3,.3)--(1.5,.3) node[midway,below]{$x$};
    \fill[red] (2,1) circle (.06);
    \draw[vectors,red] (2,1)--(3,1) node[above]{$\bm F_e$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The constant $k$ (called the \textbf{spring constant}, \textbf{force
  constant}, \textbf{Hooke's constant} or \textbf{spring rate}) is the
stiffness of the spring. It has a unit of \si{\newton\per\metre}.



\subsection{Fluid Resistance (Drag)}

When an object (e.g.\ an aircraft, a bicycle or a car) moves through air, or
when a submarine moves under water, they all experience a
fluid\footnote{A gas or a liquid} resistance force called the
\textbf{drag} $\bm F_d$.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{.338\textwidth}
    \pic1{dynamics/boeing787}
    \caption{A commercial aircraft flying through air}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}{.35\textwidth}
    \pic1{dynamics/ganna}
    \caption{A cyclist riding at high speed during a bike race}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}{.263\textwidth}
    \pic1{dynamics/submarine}
    \caption{A submarine moving through water}
  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
The drag force is experienced by any object moving through a fluid. The
direction of drag is in the opposite direction to the velocity vector.

There are multiple sources of drag:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{form drag} is due to the shape of the object
\item\textbf{skin friction} is due to the friction of the fluid against
  the surface of the object moving through it
\item\textbf{interference drag} is due to when airflow around one part of
  an object occupying the same space as the airflow around another part
  (e.g.\ fuselage and wing of an airplane)
\end{itemize}

Unlike kinetic friction (which is constant), drag depend on the speed of the
moving object, as well as its shape:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    F_d=\frac12\rho v_\infty^2C_DA_\text{ref}
  }
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
    \rowcolor{pink}
    \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
    Magnitude of drag       & $F_d$     & \si\newton \\
    Density of the fluid    & $\rho$    & \si{\kilo\gram\per\metre\cubed}\\
    Free-stream velocity    & $v_\infty$ & \si{\metre\per\second} \\
    Reference area          & $A_\text{ref}$ & \si{\metre\squared} \\
    Drag coefficient        & $C_D$     & (no unit)
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
$C_D$ depends on the shape and surface smoothness of the object; for bluff
bodies $A_\text{ref}$ is the frontal area; for streamlined objects
$A_\text{ref}$ is the planform (top-view) area




\section{Free Body Diagrams}
A free-body diagram is used to visualize the forces acting on an object. It is
very useful tool that should be used all the time.
\emph{We generally draw the forces from an inertial frame of reference.}

  \item If it is on a surface, there is also a normal force $\bm F_n$

\section{Examples of Free Body Diagrams}



\section{Solving Force Problem}
Once the free-body diagram has been drawn,
\begin{itemize}
\item Break down the forces into the $x$ and $y$ components
\item Sum forces in the direction that doesn't have a net force (usually
  $y$ axis)
\item Sum forces in the other axis, and find out what the acceleration is
\item Use kinematic equations to solve the motion of the object along that axis
\end{itemize}




\begin{example}
  To move a \SI{45}{\kilo\gram} wooden crate across a wooden floor
  ($\mu=0.20$), you tie a rope onto the crate and pull on the rope. While you
  are pulling the rope with a force of \SI{115}\newton, it makes an angle of
  \ang{15} with the horizontal. How much time elapses between the time at which
  the crate just starts to move and the time at which you are pulling it with a
  velocity of \SI{1.4}{\metre\per\second}?
%  \begin{center}
%    \pic{.4}{graphics/pull-box}
%  \end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  You are holding an \SI{85}{\kilo\gram} trunk at the top of a ramp that slopes
  from a moving van to the ground, making an angle of \ang{35} with the ground.
  You lose your grip and the trunk begins to slide.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If the coefficient of friction between the trunk and the ramp is 0.42,
    what is the acceleration of the trunk?
  \item If the trunk slides \SI{1.3}{\metre} before reaching the bottom of the
    ramp, for what time interval did it slide?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  A \SI{55}{\kilo\gram} person is standing on a scale in an elevator. If the
  scale is calibrated in \emph{newtons}, what is the reading on the scale when
  the elevator is not moving? If the elevator begins to accelerate upward at
  \SI{.75}{\metre\per\second\squared}, what will be the reading on the scale?
\end{example}



\begin{example}
  An elevator filled with people has a total mass of \SI{2245}{\kilo\gram}. As
  the elevator begins to rise, the acceleration is
  \SI{.55}{\metre\per\second\squared}. What is the tension in the cable that is
  lifting the elevator?   
\end{example}

%\begin{center}
%  \pic{.7}{graphics/worldslongestroadtrainwithpowertrailer8}
%\end{center}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Usually the objects are connected by a cable or a solid linkage with
%    negligible mass
%  \item All objects have the same acceleration
%  \item Require multiple free-body diagrams
%  \end{itemize}
%
%
%
%
%\section{Solving Connected-Bodies Problems}
%  To solve a connected-bodies problem, you can follow these procedures:
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Draw a free-body diagram (FBD) on each of the objects
%  \item Sum all the forces on all the objects along the direction of motion
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Direction of motion is usually very obvious
%    \item Action/reaction pairs of forces cancel, because they are
%      \emph{internal} forces %and not \emph{external} forces
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item Compute the acceleration of the entire system using the second law of
%    motion
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Remember that every object has the same acceleration!
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item Go back to the FBD of each of the objects and compute any unknown
%    forces
%  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Objects Connected by Cables}
\begin{example}
  Three masses ($m_1$, $m_2$ and $m_3$) are connected by massless cables (we
  assume that he cables are very light compared to the masses, and so we can
  ignore them without making our answers inaccurate), and pulled to the right
  by an applied force $\bm F$ across a level surface. The coefficient of
  kinetic friction between the masses and the surface is $\mu$.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[thick] (0,0)--(11,0);
      \draw[mass] (1,0) rectangle (2.5,1) node[midway]{$m_3$};
      \draw[brown,line width=2] (2.5,.5)--(4,.5) node[midway,above]{$T_2$};
      \draw[mass] (4,0) rectangle (5.5,1) node[midway]{$m_2$};
      \draw[brown,line width=2] (5.5,.5)--(7,.5) node[midway,above]{$T_1$};
      \draw[mass] (7,0) rectangle (8.5,1) node[midway]{$m_1$};
      \draw[vectors] (8.5,.5)--(10,.5) node[right]{$\bm F$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What are the forces acting on each of the masses?
  \item What is the acceleration of the system,
    {\color{blue}assuming that the cables to not break?}
  \item What are the magnitudes of the tension forces ($T_1$ and $T_2$) in the
    cables?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}



\begin{example}
  Two masses ($m_1$ and $m_2$) are stacked on top of each other above a
  frictionless table. An external force $\bm F$ is applied to $m_2$, causing
  both blocks to accelerate to the right without slipping. The coefficients of
  friction between the masses is $\mu$.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[thick] (-1,0)--(5.5,0);
      \draw[mass] rectangle (3,1) node[midway]{$m_2$};
      \draw[mass] (.75,1) rectangle (2.25,1.75) node[midway]{$m_1$};
      \draw[vectors] (3,.5)--(4.5,.5) node[right]{$\bm F$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the maximum acceleration of the masses without slipping?
  \item What is the magnitude of the external force $F$ at maximum
    acceleration?
  \item What is the acceleration of $m_1$ if $F$ exceeds this maximum value?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\item A \SI{60}{\kilo\gram} block slides along the top of a
  \SI{100}{\kilo\gram} block with an acceleration of
  \SI{3.0}{\metre\per\second\squared} when a horizontal force of
  $F=\SI{320}\newton$ is applied, as shown in the figure above. The 
  \SI{100}{\kilo\gram} block sits on a horizontal frictionless table, but there
  is friction between the two blocks.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item In clearly labelled free-body diagrams, draw and label all forces (not
    components) acting on the blocks. Forces should be drawn as arrow
    orginating at, and pointing away from, the dots that represent the blocks.

  \item Find the coefficient of kinetic friction between the blocks.
    
  \item Find the acceleration of the \SI{100}{\kilo\gram} block during the
    time that the \SI{60}{\kilo\gram} block maintains contact.

\item A \SI{2.0}{\kilo\gram} body rests on a smooth wedge that has an
  inclination of \ang{60} and an acceleration $\bm a$ to the right such that
  the mass remains stationary relative to the wedge.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find acceleration $\bm a$.
  \item What would happen if the wedge were given a greater acceleration?
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item A pick-up truck with two stacked crates in the truck bed brakes
  quickly. The crate on the bottom just barely stays put on the bed of the
  truck. Does the top crate stay put or does it fall off? The top crate has a
  mass of \SI{27}{\kilo\gram} and the mass of the bottom crate is
  \SI{22}{\kilo\gram}. The coefficient of static friction between the bottom
  crate and the truck is 0.42, and the coefficient of kinetic friction for
  that surface is 0.35. The coefficient of static friction between the crate
  is 0.40, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.32.
